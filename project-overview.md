NSFW-capable AI image generation app, built on Next.js, acting as a secure API gateway to Replicate.

This backend is designed to be:

- Stateless and scalable
- Secure (hides third-party API keys from users)
- Simple and focused (single API endpoint)
- Ready for future extensions

🔧 Project Role: What the Backend Does
Purpose Details
Secure Proxy Layer Forwards prompt requests to Replicate API, keeping the real key hidden
Prompt Preprocessing Validates and cleans user prompts
Request Monitoring Logs request info (IP, user-agent, prompt) for analytics
Rate Limiting Controls API usage (protects third-party quota)

🔄 API Endpoint: /api/generate-image
Request:
POST /api/generate-image
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
"prompt": "elegant nude woman, soft lighting, golden hour"
}

Backend Flow:

1. Next.js API route receives request
2. Prompt validation runs
3. Replicate API call is made
4. Image URL is returned to client

🧠 Core Logic: replicate.ts

```typescript
import Replicate from 'replicate';

const replicate = new Replicate({
  auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_KEY,
});

export async function generateImage(prompt: string) {
  const output = await replicate.run('black-forest-labs/flux-schnell', {
    input: {
      prompt,
      width: 768,
      height: 1024,
      num_inference_steps: 30,
      guidance_scale: 7.5,
    },
  });

  return output;
}
```

✅ Prompt Validation Example

```typescript
export function validatePrompt(prompt: string): {
  isValid: boolean;
  error?: string;
} {
  const lowerPrompt = prompt.toLowerCase();

  // Basic content filtering
  if (
    lowerPrompt.includes('illegal') ||
    lowerPrompt.includes('non-consensual')
  ) {
    return { isValid: false, error: 'Prompt violates terms' };
  }

  return { isValid: true };
}
```

📜 Sample .env.local File

```
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_token_here
```

🔁 Response Format

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://replicate.delivery/pb/somehash/output.png",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

✅ Summary: What the Backend Enables

- Simple, secure API gateway to Replicate
- Basic content filtering
- Ready for future enhancements
- Easy to deploy on Vercel

# Features Missing

1. **Text Creation**

   - Currently only supports image generation
   - Need text-to-text AI model integration (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - Text editing/formatting tools

2. **User Authentication**

   - Current solution is anonymous with local storage
   - Need proper sign-up/login system
   - User profiles with saved creations

3. **Content Moderation**

   - Admin panel to review community content
   - Auto-moderation for obvious violations
   - User reporting system

4. **Enhanced Sharing Features**

   - Social sharing (Twitter, Instagram)
   - Collections/albums for organizing content
   - Private vs. public sharing options

5. **Advanced Generation Options**

   - Style controls and fine-tuning parameters
   - Multi-image generation (variations)
   - Editing/inpainting existing images

6. **NSFW should be supported**
   - Should be more expensive when using token
   - Can be exclusive to Pro Subscribers

# Payment Model Options

## Coin-Based System

- **Pros:**
  - One-time purchases that don't expire
  - Users only pay for what they use
  - Flexible tiers of credit packages
  - No recurring billing concerns for customers
- **Cons:**
  - Less predictable revenue
  - Requires managing coin economy
  - Need to balance coin costs with server costs

## Subscription Model

- **Pros:**
  - Predictable recurring revenue
  - Easier financial forecasting
  - Can offer tiered plans (Basic/Pro/Enterprise)
  - Customers may forget to cancel (business advantage)
- **Cons:**
  - Higher barrier to entry
  - Customer commitment anxiety
  - Churn management required

## Hybrid Approach

- Free tier with basic limitations
- Subscription for regular users with core features
- Coin purchases for premium features or higher quality generations
- Example: "5 free generations daily, or subscribe for 100/month, premium styles cost extra coins"

## Implementation Considerations

- Supabase already handles authentication well
- Need to add payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Consider user acquisition strategy (generous free tier early on)
- For image models, costs scale with usage (unlike fixed-cost SaaS)

A hybrid model would likely work best for this type of content generation app, allowing casual users to participate while monetizing power users appropriately.
